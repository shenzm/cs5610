                        <strong> Navigation Bar: </strong>
                        Navigation bar is an utility shared across all views. It has a link for the book search page
                        at the left corner, and signin/signup link at the right corner. The navigation is fixed
                        at the top of the web page to make it easier to reach when user are browsing the web-app
                        with a small screen device, such as their phone.
