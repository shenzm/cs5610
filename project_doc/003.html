                general search on all book attribute or perform a specific search on particular book attributes

                        <strong> Search Form </strong>
                        As show in the following screen shot, the search form consist of an input field and a
                        selection drop-down input field. By leaving the selection field blank, user can perform
                        a general search. Otherwise, if the user choose a specific attribute, they can also

                        <strong> Search Pager: </strong>
                        The search result will be displayed under the search form in list of maximum 10 books.
                        After the search button is clicked the controller will send an AJAX call to Google Books
                        API and retrieve book information. And the first time, only the first 10 books will be
                        returned if there are more than 10 books in the result set. After that, user can always
                        navigate through different pages of the book search result.
                    </p>

                Notice that the styling of ReadiBook is based on bootstrap. And it uses the "flaty" theme of bookstrap.
