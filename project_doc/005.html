                        <strong> Follow Friends: </strong>
                        At mentioned before, the app will recommend a list of users at the bottom of the
                        book detail page who have already favorite the book. So this would be a chance for
                        users to find other similar taste readers. And after adding a user as friend, they
                        can browser their friends follow list, in which may be some other user that shares
                        the same interest with them. So this chain of friends are really useful to find
                        interesting book to read.
