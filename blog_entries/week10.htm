<h2>Week10</h2>

<p>
    On the 10th week, I focus on completing the UI components, and revising
    previous UI pages with more sophisticated design<br />

</p>

<h5>Passport - Simple Authentication</h5>

    This experiment focus on using bootstrap templates and tool kits to redesign the landing
    page of our application. It also add a footer for on the page which shows across all the views.
</p>

<h5>UI - Advanced navigation bar</h5>
<p>
    This experiment focus on improve the existing navbar by adding the logic to only expose
    certain links to users according to their login state.
</p>

<h5>UI - Advanced Sign Page</h5>
<p>
    This experiment focus on redesign the sign in page, and provide links to other user case,
    such as "Register" and "Forgot Password".
</p>

<h5>UI - Profile Page I</h5>
<p>
    This experiment build up the profile page of the user, which can be viewed by logged in users.
    It provide basic information of the related user, as well as the app-related info.
</p>

<h5>UI - Profile Page II </h5>
<p>
    This experiment is based on the last experiments, it provide a right-col of the profile page,
    it is a tab navigation panel, which can be used to display more detailed user information.
</p>

<h5>Summary :</h5>
<p>
    In this week's experiments, I revise the navigation bar, home page(landing page), signin page
    and profile page. The UI looks better, and building up the UI helps bulding up the architecture
    of the web application, and gives a clear mind of what functions need to be implemented
    in the back end.
