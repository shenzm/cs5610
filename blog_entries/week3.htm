<h2>Week3</h2>

<p>
    On the third week, I focused on learning javaScript and jQuery. Following 
    are the five experiments I have done: : <br />
    1) Javascript - Simple Animation <br />
    2) jQuery - Draggable Wigget Tryout <br />
    3) jQuery - Easy paragraph manager <br />
    4) jQuery - Web API calling with AJAX <br />
    5) jQuery - Foldable Panel <br />
</p>

<h5>Javascript - Simple Animation</h5>
<p>
    Incorparate with DOM, javascript is the basic way to change the web page element 
    dynamically at the client-side. This experiment use JS to adjust how the div with 
    id "object" is rendered in the browser.
</p>

<h5>jQuery - Draggable Wigget Tryout</h5>
<p>
    This experiment uses the jQuery UI wigget to implement a simple component in the web
    page that can create public new tags and drag it to user's own tag box from the public 
    one.
</p>

<h5>jQuery - Easy paragraph manager</h5>
<p>
    This experiment creates a simple web aplication that is similar to an editable 
    commenting system, where user can add/drag/save/load paragraphs. Basically, It 
    uses click function for jQuery objects and defines a bunch of functions that 
    support all kinds of the operations. And uses the web browser's local storage to
    temporarily stores the position data of the paragraphs. 
</p>

<h5>jQuery - Web API calling with AJAX</h5>
<p>
    AJAX is the most commonly used technology in javascript that can load data
    dynamically from web APIs and partially updates the web page according to the data.
    This experiment uses web API of http://www.myapifilms.com/ to search movie informations 
    from IMDB.
</p>

<h5>jQuery - Foldable Panel</h5>
<p>
    The foldable panel is similar to the &lt;detail&gt; tag in HTML5, that only displays
    the summary of a detailed paragraph at usual state. And the detail content will be displayed
    if the user click on the panel title. jQuery provides a slideToggle() function that
    support the toggling of all html object.
</p>

<h5>Summary :</h5>
<p>
    I will definitely use jQuery to develop my web page front-end, since its a cross
    browser framework that hind a lot of different implementation from developers.
