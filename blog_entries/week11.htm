<h2>Week11</h2>

<p>
    On the 11th week, I focus on completing the register function
    and revise the UI of my web page <br />
    1) Register Page I - UI <br />
    2) Register Page II - Controller Logic <br />
    3) Register Page III - register API <br />
    4) AngularJS and Bootstrap - Carousel <br />
    5) AngularJS and Bootstrap - Tabs <br />
</p>

<h5>Register Page I - UI</h5>
<p>
    Since we already create a Log in page in previous experiments. This experiment focus
    on create a registration page for the website.
</p>

<h5>Register Page II - Controller Logic</h5>
<p>
    This experiment is based on the UI layout of the last experiments. And it adds the controller
    logic for input validation as well as backend service API call to actually register the user account.
</p>

<h5>Register Page III - register API</h5>
<p>
    This experiment focus on implementing the backend service API for register, which handles the register
    request and insert new user entries into the database collection if the request is valid.
</p>

<h5>AngularJS and Bootstrap - Carousel</h5>
<p>
    This experiment build up a welcome page for the newly register users to inform their succeed registration.
    And it defines a image carousel that show user images that related to the websites theme.
</p>

<h5>AngularJS and Bootstrap - Tabs </h5>
<p>
    This experiment is an upgrade of last weeks experiments on tabs. And we provide a more user friendly tab
    UI component.
</p>

<h5>Summary :</h5>
<p>
    In this week's experiments, I revise the tab widget and carousel widget using the Bootstrap UI module of
    AngularJS, which can significantly reduce the amount of code. And the other UI widget in it is also worth
    using in the rest of the project. On the other hand, I also roughly finished register function.
