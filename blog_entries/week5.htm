<h2>Week5</h2>

<p>
    On the 5th week, I made use of Bootstrap to update page stype for all 
    experiement page, and focused on experimenting AngularJS. Following
    are the five experiments I have done: <br />
    1) AngularJS - Routing and Multiple Views <br />
    2) AngularJS - Routing and Service <br />
    3) AngularJS - Routing and Service II <br />
    4) Bootstrap - Modal SignIn Dialog <br />
    5) Bootstrap - Accordian Like Panels <br />
</p>

<h5>AngularJS - Routing and Multiple Views</h5>
<p>
    This experiment use AngularJS's routing module called 'ngRoute' to build a 
    single-page app that has multiple views, which can jump between each other, 
    using a common navigation bar. This is usdful since by using this we don't
    need to do a full refresh to change the web page content, but still provide
    the ability to.
</p>

<h5>AngularJS - Routing and Service</h5>
<p>
    This experiment is based on last experiment, other than multiple views, 
    it also defines a service with some useful functions that can be used across 
    these views. By creating global accessable functions shared between all views,
    it increased reusablity and shared data structures.
</p>

<h5>AngularJS - Routing and Service II</h5>
<p>
    This experiment is based on last experiment, we already have multiple views and a
    global service that can be called in the controller. So we enrich the global service
    functions to support more interactive multiple view design.
</p>

<h5>Bootstrap - Modal SignIn Dialog</h5>
<p>
    This experiment use Bootstrap's Modal utility to display a signin dialog that float
    above the home page when ever the sign link on the navigation bar is clicked.
</p>

<h5>Bootstrap - Accordian Like Panels</h5>
<p>
    This experiment use Bootstrap's Collapse utility to display an accordian like panel group. 
    This panel is usually used to display set of paragraphs and its title.
</p>

<h5>Summary :</h5>
<p>
    This week's experimentn, I succeed in using AngularJS to implement a multiple view 
    single-page application. Although it doesn't take full-page refresh to change
    between different views, it still provides the ability to jump forward or backward from 
    the current web page. Other than that, Some useful bootstrap pulgin also provide
    an more interactive way to present informations.
