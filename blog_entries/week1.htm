<h2>Week1</h2>

<p>
    On the first week, I focused on basic web page technologies such as HTML5, 
    CSS. During which I tried how to do responsive web page designs. Following 
    are the five experiments I have done: <br />
    1) HTML5 - New Semantic Elements <br />
    2) HTML5 - New Form Elements <br />
    3) CSS - Unified Page Style <br />
    4) CSS - CodeBox Utility Class <br />
    5) CSS - Responsive Web Page <br />
</p>

<h5>HTML5 - New Semantic Elements</h5>
<p>
    Try out new semantic elements of HTML5 which are not supported in previous
    HTML versions. Such as &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;details&gt;, &lt;figcaption&gt;. 
    These new semantic tags are supported to provide more meaningful keyword 
    for web searching. 
</p>

<h5>HTML5 - New Form Elements</h5>
<p>
    Try out new form elements of HTML5 which are not supported in previous
    HTML versions. Such as &lt;datalist&gt;, &lt;output&gt;. &lt;datalist&gt;
    tag is similar to &lt;select&gt; tag, but it allows user to input new 
    options as well as choosing from exising options. &lt;output&gt; tag can
    be used to represents the result of an input. 
</p>

<h5>CSS - Unified Page Style</h5>
<p>
    I defined a general style of experiment page using pure CSS in this 
    experiment. So it can be used across all the experiments. Basically, it 
    consist of an banner that shows the experiment number and week number, 
    a navigation bar which lead the users to the useful links at the bottom 
    of the page. And for the experiment content is consist of sub-items under
    the experiment and the related links.
</p>

<h5>CSS - CodeBox Utility Class</h5>
<p>
    This is an utiliy css class is defined to support display well-indented 
    code snippet inside of the webpage. It used a border and different background
    to differentiate the code snippet with the other paragraphs in the web page.
</p>

<h5>CSS - Responsive Web Page</h5>
<p>
    In this experiments, I applied the responsive design concept on the web page,
    which will dynamically change the font-size of the html content, layout patterns 
    and the backgound color according to the width of the web browser.
</p>

<h5>Summary :</h5>
<p>
    This week is basically updating my knowledge and gain more skills for static web 
    page design and layout part. It's the basic of web design, and its really helps
    me a lot.
