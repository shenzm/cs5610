<h2>Week2</h2>

<p>
    On the second week, I focused on utilizing existing css frameworks on web 
    page payout design. Following are the five experiments I have done: <br />
    1) Bootstrap - Fixed Nav Bar <br />
    2) Bootstrap - Carousel <br />
    3) CSS - Grid System <br />
    4) Bootstrap - Table <br />
    5) Bootstrap - Sign In Page <br />
</p>

<h5>Bootstrap - Fixed Nav Bar</h5>
<p>
    This experiment uses the Bootstrap Framework to implement an Responsive 
    Navigation Bar which fixed at the top of the web page. This is really helpful
    since the user can make use of the fixed navigation bar all the time no matter
    what part of the web page they are reading, it save user a lot of time to going
    back to the top of the web page to look for the navigation links.
</p>

<h5>Bootstrap - Carousel</h5>
<p>
    This experiment uses the Bootstrap Framework and some customized css to implement 
    a carousel uilitliy than can display multiple images in turns. Although the images
    automatically changes over time, but user can still change the image by hand by 
    clicking the left / right arrow.
</p>

<h5>CSS - Grid System</h5>
<p>
    This experiment creates a grid system by imitating grid system of Bootstrap Framework. 
    Basic idea is to define different versions of "col-1" to "col-12" for various screen 
    size. These "col" class are prefixed with "xs"(extra small), "sm"(small), "md"(medium),
    "lg"(large), which means their rules are going to apply on certain screen size. 
    we can use the css property "@media (min-width: )" to differentiate different size of
    the brwoser.
</p>

<h5>Bootstrap - Table</h5>
<p>
    Since a table is a great way to display a series of data in the web page. I
    tried out how to use the Bootstrap Framework to create an well formed table.
</p>

<h5>Bootstrap - Sign In Page</h5>
<p>
    A login page is also need for almost every website nowadays to gather users information,
    and display web page according to the login user. This experiment uses the Bootstrap 
    Framework and some customized css to implement a login page. User can choose "Remember Me"
    options as well when they are logging in.
</p>

<h5>Summary :</h5>
<p>
    It helperful to have a well defined CSS framework that we can make use of. It would be
    extremely wasteful to buld up the webpage's layout from scratch by hand.
