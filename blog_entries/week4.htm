<h2>Week4</h2>

<p>
    On the 4th week, I made use of Bootstrap to update page stype for all 
    experiement page, and focused on experimenting AngularJS. Following
    are the five experiments I have done: <br />
    1) Bootstrap - Style refinement for experiment pages <br />
    2) AngularJS - Get Avatar Application <br />
    3) AngularJS - Event Management Application <br />
    4) AngularJS - Event Management Application II <br />
    5) AngularJS - Event Detail Image View <br />
</p>

<h5>Bootstrap - Style refinement for experiment pages</h5>
<p>
    In this experiment, I use Bootstrap to refine the style of all experiment page, 
    so as to provide more user-friendly page layout, which includes code highlighting
    the code snippets. This gives me a great chance to strengthen my skills in using
    bootstrap.
</p>

<h5>AngularJS - Get Avatar Application</h5>
<p>
    This experiment is similar to the last experiment on last week. But I used 
    AngularJS instead of jQuery this time, by using the AngularJS <b>$http</b>
    method we can also gets and renders the movie information of "Avatar" movie 
    dynamically by calling Web API during the page loading
</p>

<h5>AngularJS - Event Management Application</h5>
<p>
    This experiment uses AngularJS to build up a single-page application that can 
    manage events. It include basic operation, such as add/remove event. And the 
    current event is well presented in bootstrap styled table. This is a good practice
    of using the template and event handling mechanism of AngularJS. We are making
    use of directives, such as <b>ng-model</b> to bind the data with its presentation
    and <b>ng-repeat</b> to implement the template reusing.
</p>

<h5>AngularJS - Event Management Application II</h5>
<p>
    This experiment improves the last experiment, by supporting rough seraching on 
    the events, and sorting events according to different property. We are adding
    filter properties and orderBy properties in the directives <b>ng-model</b>. Which
    is natively support by AngularJS framework.
</p>

<h5>AngularJS - Event Detail Image View</h5>
<p>
    This experiment builds an single-page app, where user can see different events 
    detail infomation, as well as the large event image by hover mouse at the small 
    event thumbnail.
</p>

<h5>Summary :</h5>
<p>
    This week's experimentn, I practiced how to build up a well-formated and templated
    web page by incorporating Bootstrap with AngularJS. Also tried out how to make 
    client-side API calls. These techiques can basically covers the front end of a web
    application. So I am really look forward to learn aboout the back-end technologies.
